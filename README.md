# Gno for Visual Studio Code

Welcome to the VS Code Gno extension!

This extension provides rich language support for the Gno programming language, including features such as IntelliSense, code navigation, code editing, and testing.

## Requirements

* Visual Studio Code 1.75 or newer (or editors compatible with VS Code 1.75+ APIs)
* Go 1.21
* [Gno](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gnovm) (Gnolang Virtual Machine)

## Quick Start

1.  Install [Go](https://go.dev) 1.21 or newer (required for automatic installation of missing tools).

2.  Install the [Gno VM](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gnovm).

3.  Install the **VS Code Gnolang** extension.

    a. Stable releases are available on the
     [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gnolang.gno).

    b. Nightly releases are available on
     [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gnoverse/vscode-gno/releases) as `.vsix` files.

4.  Open any Gno file to automatically activate the extension. The
    **Gno status bar** appears in the
    bottom right corner of the window and displays your Go version.

5.  The extension depends on `go`, `gno`, `gnopls` (the Gno language server), and optional
    tools (like `gnokey`) depending on your settings. If `gnopls` is missing, the extension will
    try to install it. The âš¡ sign next to the Gno version indicates the language server
    is running.

In addition to integrated editing features, the extension provides several
commands for working with Gno files. You can access any of these by opening the
Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), and
then typing in the command name.

## Credits

A big thank you to the developers of the [vscode-go](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go) extension for Go.
Their work was a huge help in creating this extension for the Gno language,
as I adapted their ideas and structure to fit this new context.
Thank you for your contribution to open source and for the inspiration!
