# Test explorer

## Implementation (src/goTest)
### Mapping tests

`TestItem`s themselves cannot be used with `Map`s. For non-primitive (object)
keys, Map uses strict equality. Two objects are only strictly equal to each
other if they are the exact same object. Because of this, `TestItem`s cannot be
used as map keys, as the extension host may provide different objects for the
same test. Therefore, if we want to use `TestItem`s as a map key, we must use
their ID instead.
